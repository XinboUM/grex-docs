# Introduction

Compute Canada is a Canadian National digital research infrastructore (DRI) organization. It provides the eligible researchers with the research computing resources such as several High-performance computing (HPC) systems with a large curated HPC software stack, private OpenStack cloud, and Globus data transfer software. 

Compute Canada also maintains a user authentication service and usage database called CCDB. On Grex, we rely on CCDB for accessing our system. The first step to get started with Grex is to [**register**](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application) for a Compute Canada account at the CCDB website.

### Compute Canada on the Web

- [Compute Canada official website](https://www.computecanada.ca/) 
- [CCDB, the Compute Canada accounts database](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/)
- [Compute Canada user documentation Wiki](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki) 

### Getting a Compute Canada / Westgrid Account

University of Manitoba Faculty memebers are eligible for getting ComputeCanada account. Once it is obtained, they can manage accounts of their group members in CCDBa
.
If you are a postdoc, a student or an external collaborator, you can apply for an account as part of the Faculty's group. You will need your PI's CCDB role identificator code (CCRI). [Follow this guide](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

The account will allow you to manage your roles and groups in CCDB, to access National HPC and Cloud machines, as well as few other Compute Canada services such as Globus and NextCloud. 

However, it is insufficient to access Grex.

## Regional Partners

Compute Canada is also a Federation of four Regions: Westgrid, which consists of institutional members belongigt to Western Canada, ComputeOntario, CalculQuebec and AceNET which is a consortium of universities of Matitime provinces.

- [WestGrid](https://www.westgrid.ca)

University of Manitoba is a Westgrid member insitution, and provides a site for Compute Canada support staff that support usage of the National DRI by Manitoba researchers. 

The single point of contact for Compute Canada support is:  _support@computecanada.ca_

In order to access Grex, a legacy Westgrid Consortium account is still needed. In CCDB [Apply for a Consortoim account](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/me/facilities), pick Westgrid. The website will redirect you to [portal.westgrid.ca](https://portal.westgrid.ca) and will create Westgrid account. The account (username and password) are used to connect to Grex.

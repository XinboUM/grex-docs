# Grex

Grex is a legacy system, first put in production in early 2011 as part of [Westgrid](https://www.westgrid.ca/) consortium.

The orihginal Grex is an SGI Altrix machine, with 312 compute nodes (Xeon 5560, 12 CPU cores ad 48 GB of RAM per node) and QDR 40 Gb/s Infiniband network.

It was primarily intended for applications that can take advantage of non-blocking low latency InfiniBand networks and (back then) larger memory per compute node. 

In 2017, a new Seagate **Storage Building Blocks** based Lustre filesystem of **418 TB** of useful space was added to Grex.

There are now several researcher-contributed nodes (CPU and GPU) to Grex.

Since being defunded by Westgrid (on April 2, 2018), Grex is now available only to the users affiliated with University of Manitoba and their collaborators.

"Grex" is a Latin name for "herd" (or may be "flock"?). The names of the Grex login nodes (bison, tatanka, aurochs, wisent) also refer to various kinds of bovine animals.
